The only files you need are:

UnoVideoSerial.ino (the main sketch)
UnoVideoSerial.h   (the header file)
pixelsEtc.s        (the clever pixel-pumping assembly code)
font.h

I included the assemblyDump.txt file (which the compiler produces, as part of its build cycle) just for interest's sake.
The sampleRateCalcs.ods (produced by the free Libre Office Calc program - a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet beater) might be
of interest if you want to play around with other baud rates.
